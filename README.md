# Brain Tumor Classification using EfficientNetB0 & EfficientNetB1

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model using EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB1 to classify brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained to distinguish between four categories of brain tumors:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**, structured as follows:
```
Brain Tumor MRI Dataset/
  ├── Training/
  │   ├── Glioma/
  │   ├── Meningioma/
  │   ├── Pituitary/
  │   ├── No Tumor/
  ├── Testing/
      ├── Glioma/
      ├── Meningioma/
      ├── Pituitary/
      ├── No Tumor/
```
## 📂 Dataset & Preprocessing

Dataset: Brain MRI scans categorized into four tumor types.

Preprocessing steps:

Duplicate images removed for better dataset integrity.

Image resizing and normalization.

Data augmentation to improve generalization.

Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.




## 🔍 Model Architecture

We utilized **EfficientNetB0** and **EfficientNetB1**, which are lightweight and high-performing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The models were fine-tuned on the dataset to achieve high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

## Training Process
- Data was preprocessed and normalized.
- Images were augmented to improve generalization.
- The dataset was split into **training** and **validation** sets.
- The models were trained using **TensorFlow and Keras**.
